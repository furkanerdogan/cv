# Furkan Erdoğan 
Hello, I am a 23 year old mostly self-taught computer engineer. After graduating in December of 2021, I started working as a software developer. While developing applications, I write code cleanly and with the awareness of software principles.I'm open to learning. I believe learning and development never ends. My goal is to be more knowledgeable every day than the day before.
